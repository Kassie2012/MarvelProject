sketchfab -- 3d rendering of characters
video of the marvel intro?
colors: red, white, gold, black?
character cards with a basic image they can click on that 
    will lead to the character info sheet 
        and 3d rendering

404 page
navbar 

(home, all characters, 

create a character: character editor (visual confirmation), character deletor (visual conformation alert) )

create a form to create your own character - user submits and gets an AI image of their character
it is then saved for that user and can be deleted

just to be safe, also have it where users can edit/delete information on already saved characters.
